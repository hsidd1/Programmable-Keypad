### Source code for programmable keypad designed to assist a client with joint pain due to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Built using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and Python. Case designed in Autodesk Inventor.

# Inspiration

Our client mentioned in a client meeting that he had joint pain caused by lateral movement with his hands, which often would cause his joints to pop - one of the most prevalent instances where this pain affected him was when using his keyboard.

# Our solution
This keypad allows common keyboard commands to be executed in a single click, which removes the lateral movement required to execute such commands.

For example:

instead of having to do `Windows` + `SHIFT` + `S` for a screenshot, which would be painful for the client to execute, it can now be programmed into this physical keyboard extension to allow the client to execute these commands painlessly with a single click!
Furthermore, the source code can very easily be modified to map any key to any set of keyboard instructions.
